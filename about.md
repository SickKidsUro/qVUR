#### How does the application work?

This application grades vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) from anterior-posterior x-ray scans of voiding cystorethrogram (VCUG) from the following four variables: ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) width, ureterovesical junction (UVJ) width, the maximum ureter width, and tortuosity in a unitless fashion. The application is based on images graded by the international VUR grading system (1) and described further (2).

#### How to use the application?
**Step 0 - Upload your VCUG in either .jpg or .png format, and choose only one ureter (i.e. right or left side) for the following steps**
 <br>*Step 1 - Draw a path from the UPJ to the UVJ,* this will be used to calculate the path length of the ureter and the normalization distance (the direct distance between the UVJ and UPJ on the image), and <b>tortuosity</b> is calculated from the path length divided by the normalization distance.
<br>**Step 2 - Click the two points for the edges of the UPJ,** this will be divided by the normalization distance from the Step 1 to calculate the <b>normalized UPJ width </b>
<br>**Step 3 - Click the two points for the edges of the UVJ,** this will be divided by the normalization distance from the Step 1 to calculate the <b>normalized UVJ width </b>
<br>**Step 4 - Click the two points for the edges of the ureter at the point where the ureter width is largest,** this will be divided by the normalization distance from the Step 1 to calculate the <b>normalized max. ureter width </b>
<br>**Step 5 - Click Grade VUR,** and the application will run through a decision-tree (described below) that will predict the grade of VUR for that renal side.
<br>**If required, Step 6 - Refresh and Restart Application and above steps for contralateral VCUG if present.**
