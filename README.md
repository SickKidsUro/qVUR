# qVUR

This repository contains the R Shiny files to annotate radiographic images for use in qVUR.

This application grades vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) from anterior-posterior x-ray scans of voiding cystorethrogram (VCUG) from the following four variables: ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) width, ureterovesical junction (UVJ) width, the maximum ureter width, and tortuosity in a unitless fashion. The application is based on images graded by the international VUR grading system (1) and described further (2).
